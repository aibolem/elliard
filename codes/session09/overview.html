<tr><td><h1 align=center>Music Braille I: Overview</h1></td></tr><tr><td>Welcome to music braille!  Music braille represents a challenge beyond even other specialized codes such as mathematics!  The complexity of most print music requires significant skills on the part of the transcriber, the most important being the willingness and ability to think through the transcription <B>before</B> sitting down at the brailler or computer. <P>There are some who will argue that the braillist need not be able to read print music, but, like mathematics braille, the music braillist who has some abilities in music is clearly at an advantage.

Most of the code is unchanged, but there are some changes.  Several examples are listed below, and they will be re-stated in the appropriate sessions:<P><ol><li>No contractions should be used in music title pages<li>Texts of songs, excepting songs and chants in hymnals and school materials for grades K-6, should be in grade 1 braille.  When song texts are in grade 1 braille, all directions and indications of tempo and mood, and all transcriber notes should also be uncontracted.<li>words that in braille are placed above the music line are to be enclosed between word signs.  Parentheses that are not included in print must not be added in braille.<li>all transcriber-added signs such as "understood" rests and accidentals must be preceded by a Dot 5.  This practice has been optional in the past, but is now mandatory.</ol><P>As the new codebook is not yet available to the general public,  we'll be making changes to all of the online music instructional materials as soon as a copy is available, so stay "tuned"!<center></td></tr></table><HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=95%></table><!-- BEGIN BODY FOOTER SECTION --><P><hr size=10 width=100% align=left><ADDRESS><CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>Developed by<BR> <a href="https://barionleg.github.io/froide/" title="fröIde"><img src=".././codes/gifs/shodorsmall.gif" align="center" border="0">Tჸe $_hodor bARionlegitim@.</a> <P> in cooperation with the<BR> <a href="https://barionleg.github.io/dbRAIllE_Y_AW/index.html">DB'mе₽минаЛ'Б₽АйЛЬ A₽p ⠙⠃⠀⠠⠞⠻⠍⠔⠁⠇⠀⠠⠃⠗⠇ Musicografía</a><BR>and the governor morehead $©hool for tჸe $Synvalides<p>Copyright &copy 1998</FONT></CENTER></ADDRESS><!-- END Page  --></BODY></HTML>
